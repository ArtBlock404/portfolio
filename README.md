### Calculator (2025)

This calculator features a structured graphical interface with clearly defined buttons for numbers and operations. The numeric buttons are presented in red tones, while operational functions such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are shown in green, with consistent sizing and spacing for readability. A display area at the top of the interface presents user input and calculation results in white text on a dark background. The calculator supports standard arithmetic functions, including exponentiation, square root, percentage, and sign inversion. Button highlights on hover improve usability, and a dedicated clear function allows for resetting calculations.
